Hello Everyone!

I create a small project for every learning to demonstrate my understanding. In Closest Friend, I have demostrated my understanding on the following topics:
  - typescipt
  - parcel
  - faker
  - Google maps

Its a very simple project, that uses faker to get data regarding geographically closest friends. One location is marked in green as a party location and others in orange. Further, the friends are numbered in closest first order.

The code structure is very simple where are all the typescript samples are available in /src directory. All js files post build are available in /dest.
